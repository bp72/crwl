<h1>Crawler</h1>

**crwl** is an open source web crawler in Golang which allows you to traverse entire site. Using it, you can scan, benchmark and validate your site, for example evaluate [connected component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)) or [internal pagerank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)

### Motivation
I faced problem to crawl site as-is for various reason: create set site structure as graph, validate it, benchmark.
